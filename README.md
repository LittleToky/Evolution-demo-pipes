## What used

- React
- TypeScript
- Pixi https://reactpixi.org/ (canvas library)

## Notes

- There is no design as I'm not good in it. Excuse me for not perfectly feating tiles.
- Blinking doesn't look good but I left it for interview - it shows when tiles are blocked. Console logs left in comments in most informative places also for interview.
- I didn't write any tile animations as solver is more demonstrative task
- There is simple validation before we are able to send "verify" command.
- I didn't finish solver so it can only help but not solve level automaticaly. For same reason it stacks and rotates the same cell. Solver can unstack after user move. Whish I had more time for this.
- password from first level JustWarmingUp
